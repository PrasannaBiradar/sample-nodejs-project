# ECS EC2 vs. ECS Fargate Comparison

| Feature         | ECS EC2                          | ECS Fargate                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Cost**       | Pay for EC2 instances (even if underutilized). Can be cheaper at high utilization. | Pay per task/container. No need to manage EC2. Can be more expensive for small, bursty workloads. |
| **Scalability**| Manual/Auto Scaling Group for EC2. Need to manage instance types and capacity. | Scales automatically per task. No need to manage underlying infrastructure. |
| **Ops Overhead**| Must patch, monitor, and manage EC2 instances, AMIs, networking. | AWS manages infrastructure. Less maintenance, no patching EC2. |
| **Networking**  | More control (ENI per instance, custom AMIs). | Simpler, but less control over underlying host. |
| **Use Case**    | Large, steady workloads, custom AMIs, GPU/ARM needs. | Microservices, batch jobs, unpredictable workloads, serverless containers. |

## Summary
- **ECS EC2**: More control, potentially lower cost at scale, but higher ops overhead.
- **ECS Fargate**: Easier, less maintenance, scales per container, but can be pricier for large/steady workloads.
